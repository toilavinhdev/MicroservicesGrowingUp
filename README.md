# Microservices Growing Up

###### I built my first microservices architecture web application with .NET

### Technologies used:
- .NET 8 minimal API
- SQL Server, Mongo
- Redis
- GRPC
- RabbitMQ
- YARP for API Gateway
- Docker
- ...
- Comming soon: Elastic Stack, WebSocket, Hangfire, Nginx, ...

More important than security for services, I'm trying to implement it

And I'm still continuing to explore and build...
